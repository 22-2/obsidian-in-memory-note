# In-Memory Note

A simple scratchpad for Obsidian for temporary thoughts and quick notes. Content exists only in the current tab and is never saved to your vault.

> **Note**: Only one note can be edited at a time. All open in-memory note tabs share the same content.

## Demo

## Features

-   **Ephemeral Content**: Jot down ideas without creating files in your vault. Notes reside solely in memory and are discarded when the tab closes.
-   **Native Editing Experience**: Enjoy the full power and familiarity of Obsidian's built-in Markdown editor for a rich and consistent writing experience.
-   **Session Resilience**: Your in-memory note content is preserved within your Obsidian session history. If a tab is accidentally closed, you can easily restore its content by reopening the view.

### Acknowledgements / Inspiration

This plugin's concept and some implementation ideas were partly inspired by the excellent [obsidian-lineage](https://github.com/ycnmhd/obsidian-lineage) plugin by ycnmhd. We appreciate their work in demonstrating innovative ways to interact with Obsidian notes.
